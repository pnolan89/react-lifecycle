# Lifecyle Methods in React

Every component created in React has a lifecycle. This involves the component being created, its state and props changing from updates, and being unmounted (removed) from the DOM.

This document will explain the phases of the React Component Lifecycle, and some common methods associated with each phase.

## The React Component Lifecycle

### Phase 1: Mounting
The mounting phase is where the React component is first created. The code that constitutes the component, along with React's internals, are inserted into the DOM.

### Phase 2: Updating


### Phase 3: Unmounting


### Phase 4: Error Handling
